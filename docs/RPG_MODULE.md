# The RPG Module: rulebooks as engine domain

_Design record, started 2026-08-09. Everything here was decided in
owner discussion; sections marked DESIGN are agreed direction not yet
built; OPEN items are undecided. This document is the canonical capture:
if the conversation and this file disagree, fix the file._

## The one-sentence version

The engine learns what a rulebook IS; a game supplies which rulebook it
plays by, as data; an LLM referees by reading rules and world from the
same knowledge graph, writing through the same validated grammar as
everything else.

## Why this is engine domain

The concepts below (tables you roll on, checks with targets, procedures
with steps, constants buried in prose, referee judgment points) are not
Traveller concepts. Any tabletop-derived ruleset is made of them,
including ones a game invents for itself. By the engine's own boundary
rule, "would it make sense in a farming game and a combat game equally":
it would. First consumer: logoveyer (issue #48).

## The stack

```
ENGINE   rulebook meta-ontology  what any book of rules is made of
         ingestion pipeline      LLM extracts, machine verifies
         rule executor           rolls checks, rolls tables,
                                 applies outcomes via registry
GAME     cepheus layer           what THIS book says: per-chapter
(logoveyer)                      schema packs + rule instances in
                                 the KG. Nothing of ours in it.
         voyager layer           what OUR game changes and adds.
                                 Cherry-picks cepheus by import.
                                 Sole home of deviations.
```

Layer separation is 100% by owner decision: the diff between cepheus
and voyager is the game's design document.

## The meta-ontology (DESIGN)

Engine schema pack, `schema/packs/rulebook.yaml`, opt-in like earth and
space. Classes earn existence by the RULE OF TWO: no meta-class until
two concrete instances from real text need it. Logic stays in code:
a ProcedureStep names a primitive, it never computes.

| Class | Models | First instances (Cepheus ch. 1) |
|---|---|---|
| DiceExpression | count, sides, modifier | 2D6, 1D6 |
| TaskCheck | characteristic ref, target, dice | Navy survival Int 5+ |
| RollableTable | die, ordered entries | Athlete cash benefits |
| TableEntry | roll value(s), outcome | 3 -> Cr20000 |
| Outcome | a KG-OP TEMPLATE (see below) | grant skill, +1 Int, gain Cr |
| RuleConstant | value + verbatim quote | prior-career DM -2 |
| Procedure / ProcedureStep | ordered steps naming code primitives | the book's chargen checklist |
| JudgmentPoint | "the Referee may..." spots, prompt text | alien Soc halving |
| Cited (mixin) | source file, section, quote on everything | every row above |

## No magic strings (decided 2026-08-09)

Captured data contains POINTERS TO ONTOLOGY ELEMENTS and KG
EXPRESSIONS, never bare names. `Athletics` is a reference that must
resolve to a skill defined in the cepheus skills pack; `+1 Int` is an
increment op against a schema slot. The verifier rejects any reference
that does not resolve. Verbatim source text rides alongside every typed
value for audit:

```yaml
- rank: 0
  bonus:
    text: "[Athletics-1]"
    op: {grant_skill: cepheus:skill/athletics, level: 1}
```

Consequence, resolved decision: SKILLS ARE ONTOLOGY ELEMENTS, not
strings and not a bare enum, because rules must point at them.

## Outcomes are KG-ops (the keystone)

The engine already has one validated write grammar: KG-ops
(parse -> validate against ontology -> apply), used by the Logogenesis
materializer and specified for the Director. Decision: the BOOK's
outcomes are parameterized KG-ops, and the referee's writes are KG-ops.
One write path for the book, the referee, and the game. An Outcome the
validator rejects cannot ship, whether a Haiku extracted it from a
table or an Opus improvised it mid-session.

## Ingestion: LLM extracts, machine verifies (DESIGN)

The pipeline, re-runnable at will per chapter, re-runnable when the
SRD source commit bumps:

```
(chapter file, target shapes) -> LLM extraction -> three checks -> data
  1. VERBATIM   every extracted value string-matches into the source
  2. SCHEMA     output validates against the ontology (refs resolve)
  3. INVARIANT  counts the book fixes (24 careers, ranks 0..6, ...)
```

A hallucinated number matches nothing and fails loudly. The verifier is
the only load-bearing code and serves every chapter of every book.

## Execution (DESIGN)

Engine executor: roll(TaskCheck), roll_on(RollableTable),
apply(Outcome). Outcomes dispatch through a handler registry: engine
ships generic handlers (grant skill, increment slot, gain credits, all
as validated KG writes), games register exotic ones. Dice are
engine-side, seeded, journaled, cited by roll id; the referee requests
rolls and receives facts. A referee that could assert a die result
would be wrong by construction.

## The referee (DESIGN)

A meta-agent in the engine's existing sense: reads the full KG (rules
AND world, same graph, same query shape), writes through KG-ops,
narrates through the chat window. Per turn it receives: rule text for
the current step (cited), a KG snapshot, the journal tail, completed
rolls as facts. It returns narration, ops, and requests. "Create on the
go" is bounded improvisation: procedural content comes from the book's
own tables via requests; schema-bounded content through validated ops;
pure narration is its own.

## The decision ladder (DESIGN, owner vision 2026-08-09)

Most of a session is not the referee. Gameplay decisions route to the
cheapest tier that can honestly make them:

| Tier | Who | Latency | Handles |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | engine rules, GOAP, executors | none | movement, combat math, checks, table rolls, routine NPC behavior |
| 1 | pre-prepared content | none | dialogue trees (a-b-c), prepared scenes, pre-created characters with items |
| 2 | fast LLM (Haiku-class) | a speech beat | the ever-present L option: free-form dialogue, immediate NPC reactions |
| 3 | referee (Sonnet-class) | masked by in-game time | scene preparation, plot, the out-of-the-ordinary, judgment the book leaves to the Referee |

Load-bearing properties:

- TIME IS THE MASK. In-game time passing is a property; tier-3 latency
  hides inside travel, scene cuts, nights. Tiers 0-1 keep running
  underneath: the world does not stop because the referee is thinking.
  It is acceptable to make the player wait when it is worth it.
- THE REFEREE WORKS AHEAD. Most tier-3 work is preparation during
  quiet: dialogue trees, scenery, seeded NPCs, before the player
  arrives. The slow tier is rarely on the critical path.
- THE BAKE-BACK IS THE SAFETY. Tier-2 free-form output has
  consequences: it returns narration + validated KG-ops + an NPC
  INTENT (attack, flee, pacify), and an intent is a GOAP goal executed
  by the creature's own in-world brain (the #37 NPC layer). Canon
  cannot corrupt: tier 2 reads only the KG and writes only through the
  validator; its worst case is a refused op.
- Escalation policy lives ON THE CONTENT (leaning, confirm at build):
  an NPC carries its tree, persona brief and escalation marks; a scene
  carries what is prepared and what escalates.
- Dialogue trees: a-b-[c]+L, branches pre-created per character as
  part of story/context; L always present, engages tier 2.
- Slice 1 needs almost none of this (chargen is tier 3 conversational
  plus tier 0 rolls); the ladder is built when the ship-interior slice
  brings NPCs. Rule of two applies to its meta-classes
  (DialogueNode, PersonaBrief, PreparedScene).

## Decisions log

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-08 | Absorb Traveller; the book is the spec; referee cannot roll; everything watchable (rule 12) |
| 2026-08-08 | Spin: psionics-forward frontier sensibility; EA's Sentinel Worlds is tone inspiration only, no names/text/assets |
| 2026-08-09 | Bundled in-repo as examples/logoveyer, the engine's LLM-runs-a-game showcase |
| 2026-08-09 | Pure Cepheus (Mongoose dropped); source is orffen/cepheus-srd mdBook, commit-pinned; credit in README, owner sends personal note |
| 2026-08-09 | Two game layers, 100% separated; cepheus targets 100% of the book's data model; per-chapter packs 1:1 with SRD files |
| 2026-08-09 | Character is the book's class; Voyager is_a Character, game layer, holds all deviations (incl. learn-by-doing growth if ever adopted) |
| 2026-08-09 | All 24 careers adopted as data now; procedure stays basic (no aging/injuries/draft yet); Drifter mandatory (the book's fallback) |
| 2026-08-09 | Rulebook meta-ontology + ingestion + executor are ENGINE domain (this module); rule of two; logic stays in code |
| 2026-08-09 | No magic strings: ontology refs + KG expressions everywhere; skills are ontology elements; outcomes are KG-ops |
| 2026-08-09 | Ingestion is LLM-extraction with the three-check verifier, not per-format parsers |
| 2026-08-09 | OPEN-1 decided: override = COPY-ON-WRITE FORK (option C). Voyager copies a book rule entity, edits the copy; runtime loads ONLY voyager's set. Guardrails: forked_from + content hash on every fork; CI drift check reports (not gates) when the cepheus original changes after a fork |
| 2026-08-09 | Procedure primitives: THIN, sub-step grain, the book's own gotos transcribed as routing data (outcome label -> step id, nothing else in data; conditions live in primitives). The more granularity the better |
| 2026-08-09 | Rule text per turn: curated fragments, LEARNABLE. Referee may request find_rule(query); the engine searches the vendored SRD (plain text first); results are BAKED BACK as curation-link entities in the KG, so curation grows by play |
| 2026-08-09 | Orchestration: the DECISION LADDER (see section below). Time passing masks LLM latency; the referee works AHEAD of play; free-form output bakes back as validated ops + NPC intents that become GOAP goals |
| 2026-08-09 | Models: Sonnet-class referee, Haiku-class fast tier and extraction, KISS; Opus-class noted for heavy world creation later. Model is config, never a constant |
| 2026-08-09 | Rule instances load as KG-OPS FILES applied at game start (ingestion emits ops; one write grammar for book, referee, game). World persistence direction: LAYERED MANIFEST, never a monolith: named+versioned seed layers (engine, cepheus@commit, voyager@version, worldgen@seed) plus a session delta (ops or snapshot+journal). Snapshot is a cache, not a format. KG save/load is future ENGINE work |

## OPEN (not yet decided, do not build past them)

1. The primitive list for chargen's Procedure steps.
3. Rule-text selection per referee turn (curated fragments vs retrieval).
4. Turn cadence and interruption model for the referee loop.
5. Referee dev transport (scripted responder stub first, per Logogenesis
   AT pattern) and model choice.
6. Where rule INSTANCES load from: data files into KG at start, or
   generated into the game registry. Leaning data-into-KG; undecided.
